    		<h2 id="homeHead">My Journey Thus Far....</h2>
    			<h3 id="beginning">Getting Started</h3>
    				<p>I've wanted to learn an applicable skill for many years now. Finally, after a long and arduous journey involving hours of:</p> 
    				<p id="journeylist" style="text-align: left;">
    					<br>Installing 
    					<br>Testing
 					    <br>Breaking
    					<br>Attempting to Fix
    					<br>Googling the issue
    					<br>Uninstalling then reinstalling   
    					<br>Getting irritated at my own lack of knowledge
    					<br>Googling it again with ever so slighltly different wording
    					<br>Finding a solution for the exact opposite of what I want
    					<br>Placing the project on hold for days if not weeks
    					<br>Running one last Google search, finding something close enough that I can tinker
    					<br>Hear my wife Google it and find a program for what I'm doing
    					<br>Struggle for one more week
                  		<br>Give up and buy the program
                  </p>
    			  <p id="backstory" style="text-align:left;">As I'm sure many of you experienced the same situation, numerous times. Then the struggle of figuring out how to learn. If you haven't yet, I want you to Google : "learn to code". Seriously, I'll wait. The results are <strong>outrageous</strong>.To make matters worse, you have to now figure out:
                  </p>
    				<ul>
    					<li>Traditional Learning</li>
				    	<li>Self-Taught</li>
    						<ul>
    						<li>Books</li>  
    						<li>Mobile app</li>
    						<li>Online Courses</li>   
    					</ul>
    					Then you have to figure out
    					<ul>
    					<li>Paid Learning</li>
    					<li>Free Learning</li>
    					</ul>
    				</ul>
    				<p>Then after figuring out those additional requirements, finding one that teaches you what you want to learn, in a way that you learn. The task can be overwhelming.
    				</p>
    				<br>
   		 			<p>For me, I have found a decent understanding through the combined educational systems of the mobile app Mimo, and the online courses provided by <a href="https://khanacademy.com">Khanacademy.com</a>. Mimo, providing a solid foundationin various languages, through, repetition, semi-interactive lessons, and is mostly offline. Khanacademy.com, has "talk-throughs," which are little video tutorials, narrated by an instructor, that you can pause mess with the code being input,and then continue watching. While these courses are primarily geared towards kids, they still managed to provide the additional details that my knowledge hungry mind wants. While other programs out there can provide the same level, if not better, I found that these were what would provide me the best chance to learn the subject materials that i desired, while giving me easiest time learning at my pace.
